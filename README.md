# K9 - Angular Frontend Client
Dog Grooming Management App
Front end using AngularJS and Bootstrap for K9 Restful API app - https://github.com/Spunog/k9

## Setup + Running
After cloning:
* bower install - will download dependancies
* npm Install
* gulp - process scss and js
* gulp serve - will start webserver

## Deploy Guide + Notes
* Run Gulp Build - this creates a generated version in the dist folder. This includes creating CSS files from SCSS files. Injecting JS and CSS references in the index.html folder in adidion to compressing files.
* Note there is an existing bug in that angular-layout css file is not included in the extract so index.html needs to be updated with a new ref to this e.g. styles/angular-material.layouts.min.css.
* Once the dist folder is complete simply drag and drop into Netlify or any other static hosting service.
